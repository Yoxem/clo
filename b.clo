In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was
 in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that
 was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.  And the light shineth in darkness; and
  the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
